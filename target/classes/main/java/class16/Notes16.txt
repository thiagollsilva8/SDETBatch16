Static keyword:

    - Static is a keyword that can be used with variables, methods, classes, etc.
    - When we use this keyword with a variable, that variable becomes static variables.
    - When we use it with methods, these methods become static methods.

Static variables:

    - Static variables can be accessed in all type of methods (instance, static). They can also be accessed in multiple
    objects of a class.

Static methods:

    - Static methods will have the behaviour across all the instances of a class because no instance fields are allowed
    inside the static methods.

Note:

    1. We can call the method by just writing their name if we are in the same class.
    However, if we are in a different class we need to write the class name before the method name
    if we want to call it.

Access Modifiers:

    - Controls the access of entities like variables methods. THere are 4 access levels in java:
    1. private
    2. default
    3. protected
    4. public
    - There are 3 keywords in java that can be use to apply these access levels.

-- private:

    - If we write private keyword with any variable method constructor,
    no one else outside of that class can access it.

-- default:

    - All the entities with default access can be accessed within the same class as well as in any other class
    within the same package.

-- public:

    - If something is public all the classes in a project can access it.

How do we decide the access level
====================================================================================================================
1. fields/properties/instance variables are almost always created as private.
2. Methods 70% to 80% of the time are declared as public.
3. Above 98% classes are declared as public.
