Constructor:

    A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object
    of a class is created. It is used to initialize the object with the values
    provided as arguments to the constructor. If no constructor is defined in a
    class, a default constructor is automatically created by Java.

Rules:

    1) Constructors must have same name as class name.
    2) Constructors don't have return types not even void.
    3) When we don't create a Constructors in a class, Java creates a default constructor for us
    automatically behind the scenes. It is called default constructor. It does not take any parameters.

    methods. however if you are not using any instance variables you should go
    with static.
