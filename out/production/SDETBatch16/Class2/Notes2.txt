What are variables?
   When we have to make a computer do something for us, we have to provide the computer
   with instructions and data. To store this data we need something that can help us store and
   retrieve this information when we need it. Variables help us store this data.
   There are 8 basic types of variables in java. These are called primitive data types.
   1) byte 2) short 3) int 4) long 5) float 6) double 7) char 8) boolean

Data types to store simple numbers:
    When ever we have whole numbers the numbers  without the decimal parts like
    10,50,10000,666,8888888885,-4585,-45 we use the below data types
    byte, short, int , long but as a tester 99% of the time we will be using int
    data type to store whole numbers.


Data types to store floating point Number/decimal numbers:
    Whenever we have to store floating point numbers like 10.5, 2.3 -5.6,0.0001 etc.
    we use below data types.
    1)float 2) double
    99% of the time double is used and that's what we as a tester will be using


DataType:
    is a mechanism that helps computer to store specific type of information and
    also helps it to perform calculation on that information.

Data type to store characters:
    char is the data type that we use to store the single characters like
    'a' ,'Z','-','+','1','@' etc. we can store numbers letters and special characters
    in char data type.

Data types to store true/false:
    we use the data type boolean to store ONLY true/false in java.
    is it raining=false
    are you hungry=true;

Data types to store words:
    We can use the String data type to store multiple characters together like
    "USA", "New york", "I am starving and I mean it","2763r4374","@%^#","3".
    String is a non-primitive(Advance) data type, because ot is a non-primitive
    data type that's why the first letter is always uppercase

Note:
    1)All the primitive data types start with lowercase letters like byte,short,int
    long, float, double, char, boolean.
    2) In java we follow two conventions to name class and variables
    class:
        First letter of all the words is in uppercase always
        BooleanDemo
        VariablesDemo
    variables:
        first letter of the first word is lower case but for rest of the words we
        use the uppercase letter for their first word.
        isItRaining
        myAge
        areYouHungry

Rules About variables:
    1) We can't have same name variables twice in a java class or method. Refer to VariablesDemo1
    2) Java is caseSensitive which means for java age and AGE are two totally
    different things refer to VariablesDemo2 class.
    3) We can update the value of a variable as many times as we want. refer to Variables
    Demo3 Class.
    4) If we want to print multiple variable values in a single like we can
    use String concatenation refer to StringConcatenationDemo
    5) We can't access a variable before declaring it. Refer to VariablesDemo4
    6) We can ask to print the value of something if we don't initialize it. VariablesDemo5

Arithmetic operators:
    Arithmetic operators in java are symbols that we use to perform simple basic
    Aromatic operations like Addition(+) subtraction(-) multiplication(*)
    Division(/) modules operator(%)
