What are 2D arrays:
    2D arrays are collection of 1D arrays. That we can use to store data in the form of
    rows and columns just like we have in excel files in the form of tables on webpages.

Syntax:
    Approach 1;
    Data types [][] variableName = new data types [size of rows][size of columns];

    Approach 2:
    Data types [][] variableName = {{element 1, element 2, element 3};
                                    {element 4, element 5, element 6}
                                    };

Object oriented programming:
    Object oriented programming also known as OOPs is nothing but some set of rules
    that if we follow we will have the below benefits: There are five main concepts that we
    will be learning
    (1. Classes and objects, 2. Inheritance, 3. Polymorphism, 4. Abstraction, 5. Encapsulation)

    1. Code will be organized.
    2. Code repetition will be minimized.
    3. Changing the code will become easier.
    4. It will become easier to write code by multiple team members.
    5. Security of your application will increase.
    6. Writing code for larger applications will become easier.
    7. It will help us represent the world around us easily.

Task1: Shows how OOPs will help us organize the code
