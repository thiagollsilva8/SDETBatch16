if-else:
    we have a condition based on that condition we perform some tasks.

Why should we learn about if-else conditions:
    With the help of if else conditions we can write programs which can take decisions
    based on conditions.

Syntax:
    if(condition){
    // code that we want to execute once the conditions is true
    }

we can use any data type to write this condition part with the help of
relational operators(== != > < >= <=). Once the condition is true java
executes all of the code that we write inside the {}.

Logical operators:
    Logical operators help us combine multiple conditions. There are 3 main
    types of logical operators AND(&&) OR (||) NOT !. These operators only
    work with boolean values.

Why we should use logical operators:
    they help us simplify the logic.

How does the logical NOT ! works?
    Logical NOT operator is used to convert a true value to a false value or
    a false value to a true value;

Example
    sout !true => false
    boolean var1=false;
    var1=!var1;
    sout var1=> true
    String country="Korea";
    if(!country.equals("Korea")){
    sout "You are welcome"
    }

Logical OR ||:
    Logical OR operator helps us combine multiple  conditions.
    When we want to execute something as soon as one condition becomes true.
    we should be using logical OR
    true||true=> true
    false||true=> true
    true||false=> true
    false||false=> false
    true||false||true||true=>true

Logical AND Operator:
