Task1
Prompt the user to enter person heights in inches.
Person should be classified as one of the following:
• short (under 60 inch)
• medium(between 60 -72 inch)
• tall (over 72 inch)

Switch statement:
    in switch statements once variable is checked for multiple values.
    functionality is ver similar to else-if statements but switch statements have a lot of limitations.

Why we should use switch statements:
    They are very fast.

Syntax

switch(variable){

case value1:
    output 1;
   breakl;
case value2:
    output 2;
    break;
default:
    output;

}

Limitation of switch statements:
    1) Only byte short int String and char data types are allowed.
    2) We can't use the relational operators(== != > < >= <=)
    3) We can't use the logical operators as well.
