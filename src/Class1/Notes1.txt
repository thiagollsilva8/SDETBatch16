Important things to keep in mind for this course:
    1) Pay attention during the class.
    2) Before each class, I will be sharing short videos and
    the Slides. It's a must that you go through those slides
    and watch the videos in the courseAnnouncement channel.
    3) A lot of Practice
    4) When practicing if you face any issues don't spend more
    than 15 minutes take a screenshot and post in the technical
    support channel.
===========================================================
Why we are here?
    1) To be automation engineers.

What do automation engineers do?
    They test software, but mainly you will be testing websites
    and mobile apps by writing a piece of software that will test
    the websites automatically.

Why are we learning java?
    Java is a programming language that we will be using to communicate
    with the computer so that we can guide a computer on how to test
    a website automatically.

How Programming languages work?
    They work in a very similar fashion just like how human languages work.
    They have grammar rules, vocabulary punctuation etc.
    In this part of the course we will be learning these rules for java.

What is intellij?
     Intellij is a software that we will be using to write java code just
     like we use Microsoft Word to write English. It has many features like
     it can find and fix issues in our code. It can suggest improvements. It can
     assist you to organize your code and so many other things.


What is a project in intellij?
    A project is noting but a folder that we create to organize our code
    just like we create folders on our computers to organize files.

How to create a project?
    1) File=>new=>project.
    2) once you follow the above steps you will see a pop
    3) provide the name for the project and click on create.

What is package?
    A package is nothing but another folder inside the project folder
    we create packages to organize code.

How can I create a package?
    1)Right-click on src folder=> new => package
    2) once the pop-up appears enter the name for the package

How to create Notes.txt file?
    1)Right-click on src folder=> new => file
    2) Once the pop-up appears enter the name of the file and the extension .txt

What is a class?
    A class is a java program where we will be writing our code.
    inside the classes we will be creating main method and for now
    we will write all of our code inside the main method.

How to create a class?
    1) Right-click on the package=> new=> java class.
    2) Once the pop-up appears enter the name for the class.
    Classes follow a convention that first letter of all the words should
    be upper case and there can't be any spaces between words.

Some shortcuts to write code quickly;
    1)To create the main method we just write "main" and hit the enter
    button or the tab button and intellij will automatically write a
    method for you.
    2) To print something on the console we write "sout" and hit
    the enter button or the tab button, and it should auto complete
    the print statement for you.

What are comments:
    Comments are like notes that we write with java code to explain how the
    code is working. These comments are ignored by java. There are two ways
    we can write comments
    1) Single line comments 2) multiline comments

Single line comments:
    we use two forward slashes //
    example // This is  a comment

Multiline comments:
    We use /* THis is a multiline comment
    another line
    another line
    */

Syntax:
    is set of rules that we must follow to write java code just like we follow
    punctuation when we write English.
