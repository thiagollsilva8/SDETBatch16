Class:
    A class is a template or a blueprint out of which objects are created.

Why should we use classes:
    1. They help us organize our code.
    2. Represent real life entities in code.
    3. Classes help us write code that makes it easy to reuse code.

Syntax
class ClassName {
define field/properties/attributes here
define methods here

}
Some very famous classes in java:
1. String

==============================================================================
Q1. build a program that does waste a lot of memory. It's ok if it is a little slow String.
Q2. build a program that is as fast as possible. It's ok if it takes a little more time.
StringBuilder

Method:
    Method is a block of code that contains java code which is executed when we call that
    method. In java methods can only exist inside classes.
