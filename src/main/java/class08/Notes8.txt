Loops:
    Loops help us repeat a piece of code until a condition becomes false.
    There are 4 main types of loop:
     1) While loop
     2) For loop
     3) do while loop
     4) enhanced for loop

Why should we use loops?
    loops can help us avoid duplicate code.

Syntax for while loop:
    while (condition) {
    code that we want to repeat
    }

Syntax for for-loop:
    for (initialization of variable; condition; increment/decrement operator) {
    code that we want to repeat
    }

syntax for the do-while loop:
    do {

    code that we want to repeat
    } while (condition);

How do we know which loop we should user:
    When you know exactly how many times you want to loop
    through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop
    when we don't know how many times we need to repeat a block of code we
    should be going with while loop most of the time it happens when the user
    input is involved

Break keyword:
    Break keyword is used to terminate the loop prematurely.

why we want to do that?
