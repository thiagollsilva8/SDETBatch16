Three Main Types of maps:

    1) HashMap
    2) LinkedHashMap
    3) TreeMap.

HashMap:

    Best overall performance, but it does not maintain the insertion order.

LinkedHashMap:

    It maintains the insertion order. A little slower than the HashMap.

TreeMap:

    It sorts the data based on keys. it's slower than HashMap and LinkedHashMap.

================================================================

FileHandling:

    Reading/writing data in files.

What do we need to know before we can read the data from a file:

    1) We need to have the location/Path of the file.
    2) Navigate to the location where file is stored.
    3) Software that can help us read/write data from that file.
