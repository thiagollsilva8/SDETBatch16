Interfaces:

    Interfaces are like contracts. Which guides us to create methods in a class.
    we implement interfaces. They contain public static final variables and by default
    methods are abstract.

Why we should use interfaces:

    we should use interfaces so that everyone knows which methods needs to be built.

Syntax:

    interface Interface1 {


    }
