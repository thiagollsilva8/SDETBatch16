MethodOverloading:

    - Allows a class to define multiple methods with the same name, but different signatures.

How to have different signatures?

    1. By changing the number of parameters that a method takes.
    2. By changing the dataTypes of the parameters.
    3. By changing the sequence of parameters.

Why should we overload?

    1. It brings cleanliness
    2. Increases the readability of the program.
    3. We do not have to memorize a lot of method names if we are performing the same operation.
