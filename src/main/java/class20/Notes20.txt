Method overloading:

    1. Can we overload private methods?
       Yes
    2. Can we overload the static method?
       Yes
    3. Can we overload the main method?
        Yes
    4. Can we overload a method by changing its return type?
        No
=============================================================

Create 3 animal classes(Dog, Cat, Horse). Create 5 methods in each class. If you want you can create some fields
and constructors as well. Create the object of all 3 classes and call 2 methods from each class. You must use
inheritance to avoid code duplication.

Method Overriding:

    It is when a subclass has the exact same method as parent method but a different implementation

What are the benefits of Method Overriding?

    1. Flexibility(if you don't like something from the parent class you can override it).
    2. Cleaner code.

Rules:

    1. If we want to override a method in the child class return type, method name and parameters,
    they must be the same.
    2. private methods cannot be overridden.
    3. We cannot override constructors.
    4. static methods
