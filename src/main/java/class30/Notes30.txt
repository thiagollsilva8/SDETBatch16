Methods:

    A method is a block of code that contains instructions which are executed when the method is called.

Why should we create methods?

    1)They allow us to reuse code.
    2) Save Time
    3) Save memory
    4)Code is more organized
    5) code changing becomes easier.

When should we create a method?

    If we are repeating more than 3 lines of code twice, then we should create a method.

Syntax of a method:

    returnType methodName(){

    }

    Example

    void printHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
