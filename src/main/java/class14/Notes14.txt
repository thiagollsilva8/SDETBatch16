Methods/Functions/Behaviours;
    Method is a block of code {}. When we call the method all the logic is executed inside the method.
    Method can also take parameters which is the data that we can pass when we call these methods.

Why we should learn about methods:
    1. Code re-usability
    2. Organize the code
    3. Changing the code becomes easier

Syntax:
    return type

When to create a method?
    Whenever we are repeating more than three lines of code at least twice you can go for a method.
