If else Statements:
    If else statements help us write programs that can take divisions based on data.
    they work based on the boolean values.

Syntax:

Simple If statement:
    if(condition){
    // write code here that you want to execute if condition is true
    }

If else statement.
    if(condition){
        // write code here that you want to execute if condition is true
        }else{

        }

Scanner :
    Scanner is a class that contains all the logic to take the input from the
    user using the console and the keyboard.

Why should we use Scanner class?
    If we want to write interactive programs which can take input from users
    and based on the that input we want to write a logic.

What is the syntax of Scanner class:
    1) create the object of the scanner class using below code
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    2) once we have the object of the scanner class we can call different methods
    to take different type of inputs from the user.

String(only one word):
    when we have a take String type of data only one
    word from user we can use the next() method.

String(complete line):
    if we are interested in all the words we can use nextLine method.

int:
    nextInt()

double:
    nextDouble()

boolean:
    nextBoolean()

char:
    For char there is no direct method we use the next method and then charAt method after that
    to extract the letters from the word.
    next().charAt(0) // here 0 means we are interested in the first letter

Note:
    1)we can press Ctrl+alt+l(windows) or (Cmd+opt+l) to format the code.
    2)we can click on the starting curly bracket and intellij will highlight the ending
    one.
    3)we can double-click anywhere inside a block(anything that a starting { and ending})
