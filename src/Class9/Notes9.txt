Arrays:
    Arrays are collection of items. We can store primitive and non-primitive data inside arrays.

Why should we learn about arrays?
    1. They help us manage large amounts of data efficiently.
    2. We can process the data stored in arrays using loops

Syntax:
    datatype [] variable = {element1, element2, element3, ...};

Shortcuts:
    1. After the array type: iter and intellij will write a enhanced for loop for you
    2. We can place the cursor on the for loop and click on the bulb icon to change
    one loop with anither one
