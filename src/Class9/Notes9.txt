Arrays:

    Arrays are collection of items. We can store primitive and non-primitive data inside arrays.

Why should we learn about arrays?

    1. They help us manage large amounts of data efficiently.

    2. We can process the data stored in arrays using loops

Syntax:
    We have two ways of creating the arrays

    1. datatype [] variable = {element1, element2, element3, ...};
       example: int[] number = {10, 20, 60};

    2. Datatype[] name = new datatype[sizeof array];
       example: int[] numbers = new int[5];

Enhanced For Loop:

    It's another type of loop that we can use with data structures, it automatically picks the items
    from the array and prints them one by one in each iteration.

Why should we use Enhanced?

    1. It is a cleaner code

    2. It is easier to understand

Syntax:

    for (datatype variable : arrayName) {

    }

Limitations of the Enhanced for loop;

    1. There is no index which means we will always get the data in the sequence,
    it is present in the array

    2. We cannot print the items in reverse order

    3. We also cannot update values

Shortcuts:

    1. After the array type: 'iter' and intellij will write a enhanced for loop for you

    2. We can place the cursor on the for loop and click on the bulb icon to change
    one loop with another one
